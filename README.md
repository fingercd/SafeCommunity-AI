# SafeCommunity-AI
This intelligent monitoring system is built with YOLO, YOLO_pose, LSTM, two-stream VIT, and a reward-punishment mechanism (based on public datasets). It enables real-time monitoring of various community abnormal situations, covering 80 common COCO categories, smoke, fire, human postures (via YOLOpose), long-term abnormal behaviors, theft, fighting, robbery, etc.
Ideal for community monitoring needs, the code features one-click modification of absolute paths (currently using the developer’s paths) for easy adaptation. Note that parameters and datasets are not publicly available due to copyright issues (contact the developer if needed). A detailed README (with full code explanations and comments) will be released in March 2026.
